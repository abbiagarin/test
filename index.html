                <p>Howdy! I'm Colin Wright.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I'm an author, podcast host, and generalist <a href="#" id="maker-of-things">maker-of-things.</a></p>
                <br>


                <p>I also <a href="#" id="speak">speak</a> to audiences worldwide at conferences, universities, and on </p>
                <p>the periodic national or international tour.</p>
                <br>


                <p>I spend most of my time learning, making things that I hope will be of value,</p> 
                <p>and striving to grow as a person-in terms of physical and mental health, knowledge,</p> 
                <p>resiliency, and overall capability.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I've been traveling the world full-time since 2009, and for most of that time I had</p>
                <p>my readers vote on what country I would move to next every four months or so.</p>
                <br>

                <p>For the past few years I've experimented with different models, including spending</p> 
                <p>time in unfamiliar parts of the US, fixing up and full-timing in a vintage RV (while</p> 
                <p>on tour), and at the moment, researching and visiting potential home bases to use as </p>
                <p>jumping-off points for future travels.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Somewhat More Information</h3>

                <p>I'm originally from Northern California, but I grew up in Columbia, Missouri.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Growing up, I couldn't decide if I wanted to be a chaos theorist (I was better at</p> 
                <p>back then) or comic book illustrator; I ultimately pursued a combined journalism</p> 
                <p>and fine arts trajectory in high school.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I worked a handful of design- and technology-related jobs alongside my classes at</p> 
                university, and wrote news analysis columns for local newspapers.</p>
                <br>

                <p>started my first business, a magazine, when I was 19 and still in school. The project</p> 
                <p>went well, then flopped, which was very painful and educational. I graduated with a</p> 
                </p>dual-emphasis degree in graphic design and illustration, then moved out to</p>
                <p>LA to work as a generalist "creative" at a small production and design agency.</p>
                <br>

                <p>After a year, I left the studio job to start up my own one-person operation, at first</p> 
                <p>doing an array of design, web, animation, and interactive work, before finding a</p>
                <p>niche in broader-based branding projects.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Things were going very well, business-wise, when I realized that I was sacrificing</p> 
                <p>essentially every other aspect of my life to achieve that success.</p>
                <br>

                <p>In 2009, I handed off most of my clients, sold or gave away everything I owned that </p>
                <p>wouldn't fit into carry-on luggage, and started up a blog, <i>Exile Lifestyle.</i></p>
                <br>

                <p>In the years since, I've lived in Argentina, New Zealand, Thailand, Iceland, India,</p> 
                <p>Romania, Czech Republic, and the Philippines, visited about 60 other countries and</p>
                <p> all 48 contiguous US states (twice), roadtripped South America, wandered Southeast</p> 
                <p>Asia, explored Europe by train, and enjoyed many other travel-related adventures.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Yet More Information</h3>

                <p>I'm fortunate to have a wonderful family. My parents live in central Missouri</p>
                <p>and my three siblings are scattered around the US. I have quite a few fur-</p>
                <p>nieces and fur-nephews.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I make friends and build relationships of different kinds as I travel: I have some</p> 
                <p>truly amazing and inspiring people in my life.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I'm a minimalist in that I own few things and am intentional in how I consume. This</p>
                <p>doesn't mean I'm anti-consumption, but rather that I'm careful about how I spend</p>
                <p>my time, energy, and resources (including money). I tend to buy less but invest in</p> 
                <p>quality, and I aim for the same in relationships, the work I do, and everything else.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I'm 35-years-old, left-handed, and cannot believe I get to do what I do for a living.</p>

                <h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>

                <p><strong>If you don't see an answer to your question below, feel free to <a href="#" id="contact-me">contact me.</a></strong></p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>How can I do what you do? Traveling is my dream!</strong></p>
                <br>

                <p>Great! There are many ways to travel long-term or full-time. As many ways as there </p>
                <p>are people, in fact.</p>
                <br>

                <p>1. What do you want to get out of travel? What do you hope to achieve by living in this way?</p>
                <br>

                <p>2. How might you earn an income while on the road? What skills do you possess</p> 
                <p>that might allow you to work independently or remotely, and what skills might you</p>
                <p>acquire that would help you do so?</p>
                <br>

                <p>3. What elements of your comfort zone will need to be taken into account when</p> 
                <p>figuring out expenses, locations, methods of travel, and other such considerations?</p> 
                <p>Are you comfortable being uncomfortable, or will you need a large cozy bed and a</p> 
                <p>first class plane ticket everywhere you go? There's nothing wrong with needing such </p>
                <p>things, but it's important to be aware of these preferences and needs, as you'll want </p>
                <p>to work this information into your plans.</p>
                <br>   
                    
                <p>4. It's also important to consider the ethical implications of your travels, including </p>
                <p>the emissions created by various travel methods, and the damage that can be caused </p>
                <p>by visitors to landmarks, cities, and natural settings. This damage can include</p> 
                <p>things like the transmission of diseases, but also general wear-and-tear on plants,</p> 
                <p>paths, and architecture, alongside potential economic recalibrations that can ruin</p> 
                <p>an area for locals as it becomes more accessible by visitors.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Focus on what's vital, make sure you know why you're doing it, and make sure it's</p>
                <p>sustainable: economically, but also psychologically and physically</p>
                <br>

                <p>From there, it's a good idea to set a deadline and to use the time leading up to that</p> 
                <p>deadline as a runway before take-off. Don't rush, but don't put it off forever, either.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Then go out into the world, try to leave places and people you encounter better than</p> 
                <p>you found them, and do your best to be present for the experiences you have along</p> 
                <p>the way.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Do you accept guest posts/submissions for your blog?</strong></p>
                <br>

                <p>Nope, sorry.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>
                <br>

                <p>It's just not how I use this space. Back when I first started blogging I accepted a few,</p> 
                <p>but not anymore. The blogosphere was a very different creature back then, and so was I.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Can I buy an advertisement on your blog?</strong></p>

                <p>Nope, sorry.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Wait, if you don't display ads like a smart business person, how do you make</strong></p> 
                <p><strong>money from your blog?</strong></p>
                <br>   

                <p>The short answer is: I don't.</p> 
                <br>

                <p>The longer and more complete answer is: I don't make money directly from my blog, </p>
                <p>but it serves as a means of communicating with my audience, who are able to get a</p>
                <p>taste for my work, and who may, as a result, decide to pick up one of my books,</p> 
                <p>attend a conference at which I’m speaking, or support my podcast.</p>
                <br>

                <p>It's a slow-burn means of making a living, but it’s one I feel good about. I wouldn't</p> 
                <p>be able to say the same if I bombarded folks with marketing messages or </p>
                <p>overwhelmed them with blinking ads, promoting widgets they don't need.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Will you come speak at my conference/event/school/business?</strong></p>
                <br>

                <p>Perhaps!  <a href="#" id="Here's some info about hiring me as a speaker and how that all works">Here's some info about hiring me as a speaker and how that all works.</a></p>
                <br>
        
                <p><strong>Aren't you a minimalist? Isn't it counter to your philosophy to sell books?</strong></p>
                <br>

                <p>Nope. Being a minimalist doesn't mean owning nothing, it means owning </p>
                <p>exactly the right things for one's needs and priorities. It's not about being anti-</p>
                <p>consumption, it's about being anti-compulsory consumption</p>
                <br>

                <p>I try to only own things that add value and happiness to my life. There are many</p> 
                <p>other things I could own that would only weigh me down or consume resources </p>
                <p>(time, energy, money) that I could instead spend on truly valuable things ('valuable'</p> 
                <p>being defined by my needs and priorities).</p>
                <br>

                <p>If a book brings you joy, helps you learn, or exposes you to new ideas, there's a good</p> 
                <p>chance it passes muster, minimalism-wise. Though that won't be the case for</p> 
                <p>everyone-if your money is better spent on something else according to your </p>
                <p>standards, please do that, instead.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I also encourage folks who buy my books to hand them off to a friend or donate</p> 
                <p>them to a library afterward, which is a good way to enjoy the benefits of a tangible</p>
                <p>book without adding any clutter to your life.</p>
                <br>

                <h3><strong>How do I write a book?</strong></h3>
                <br>

                <p>The first step is to start writing. A <i>lot.</i></p>
                <br>

                <p>Many people want to write a book but don’t write, or are afraid to start writing</p> 
                <p>before they feel they have the entire publishing scaffolding in place.  </p>  
                <br>

                <p>Don't do that. Don’t wait for permission.</p><br>

                <p>Get started, write all the time. It's the only way to get better, and it's the best </p>
                <p>possible way to sound more like yourself and develop your personal style.</p><br>
